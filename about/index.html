             What is Powering Change?

            <font color= "white">
            Powering change is designed and built by the staff and students at Brigidine College Randwick in collaboration with Power Tracker. The project's mission is to illustrate and analyse the school’s electricity consumption and the impact this has on our planet. Through this project we hope to reduce our energy consumption and learn more about how our consumer choices can create positive change. As we strive to reduce our negative impact on earth. We also seek to better connect with it and the those living on it, creating a better world today and for future generations.</font>

            <font color="white">How does the project work?
        </h2>
        <p class="big" style="text-align: justify;">
            <font color= "White">The project works in two ways.The website shows how much electricity we – as a school – are using daily, and how much of it is converted into Carbon Dioxide. </p>
        <p class="big" style="text-align: justify;">
            This allows us to help achieve our current goal of reducing our annual Carbon footprint by 5%. We will use our total emissions from 2016 as a baseline to compare our progress.
            There are a whole lot of things you can do to help! Check out the ‘Task List’ when you register for a range of actions you can take at school and home. </p>
         <p class="big" style="text-align: justify;">
              A place where students can compete against each other as well as different schools with the aim of completeing as many environmental tasks as possible. For each task completed, students will be rewarded points or ‘leaves’. These go to helping grow the styudents individual avatar tree and the college’s avatar tree.  Leaderboards provide the accumulated totals overall, school vs school and per student within a school. designwed to allow students to be the owners of the game giving the power to create challenges and rewards. So get creative and put your understanding of how we can reduce the climate crisis to use by creating your schools very own customized list of challenges. The harder the challenge, the more points you get, simple right? Everyone will be able to see who has completed which tasks and who may need a little help. The Energy Game is not only a great way to reduce a schools energy usage, it provides students with the knowledge and tools to reduce their carbon footprint well beyond the classroom. So lets save our planet, together! </p>
